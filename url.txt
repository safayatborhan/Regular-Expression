"https?://(www\.)?([a-z]+)(\.+[a-z]+)"
we have searched all of it, but if you see closely we could 
have written like this : 

https?://(www\.)?[a-z]+\.+[a-z]+

the first "[a-z]+" are the url name and the second "[a-z]+"
are the domain name. we have made group each of them so that
we could make use of it later. and we can achieve the group 
content by writting "$1, $2 ..." like this. $1 is first group
$2 is second group. so on so forth....
