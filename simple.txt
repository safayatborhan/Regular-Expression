comments : 
*** \d matches digits. at line 12 and 13- we are seeing 
there is a pattern of these numbers. 3 digits and after that
a special character. so, we will write some regular expression
now. like if we want to search the first 3 digits, we will 
have to search like : "\d\d\d". this will seach every place 
which have 3 digits together. but after that, we have 
"full stop/hyphen" here. To achieve this special characters, 
we can use "."- this "." can search all characters excepts
new line. but if we use this "." any other character will 
be counted. like we can see that, line 15 will also be a 
search result, if we use this. so for that, we will use
character set. this character set is written like "[.-]".
so this will return all the result that includes ". and -". 
at this moment we can write like : "\d\d\d[.-]" and final 
regular expression will be like : "\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d\d"



*** \b is used for word boundary
like in 5th line, if we want to find "ha" that has word 
boundary at the beginnning, we will search like "\bha". And 
if we want to search like word boundary at both beginnning
and end then we will have to search like "\bha\b"

*** ^ determines the beginnning of something. if we 
want to search "ha" that is only the beginnning of the 
sentence, the we will have to search like "^ha"

*** $ will be used for determining the end "ha", like : 
"ha$"
