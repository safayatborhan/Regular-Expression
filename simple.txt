comments : 

*** \b is used for word boundary
like in 5th line, if we want to find "ha" that has word 
boundary at the beginnning, we will search like "\bha". And 
if we want to search like word boundary at both beginnning
and end then we will have to search like "\bha\b"

*** ^ determines the beginnning of something. if we 
want to search "ha" that is only the beginnning of the 
sentence, the we will have to search like "^ha"

*** $ will be used for determining the end "ha", like : 
"ha$"

*** \d matches digits. at line 12 and 13- we are seeing 
there is a pattern of these numbers. 3 digits and after that
a special character. so, we will write some regular expression
now. like if we want to search the first 3 digits, we will 
have to search like : "\d\d\d". this will seach every place 
which have 3 digits together. but after that, we have 
"full stop/hyphen" here. To achieve this special characters, 
we can use "."- this "." can search all characters excepts
new line. but if we use this "." any other character will 
be counted. like we can see that, line 15 will also be a 
search result, if we use this. so for that, we will use
character set. this character set is written like "[.-]".
so this will return all the result that includes ". and -". 
at this moment we can write like : "\d\d\d[.-]" and final 
regular expression will be like : "\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d\d"

*** if we want to search only the numbers that starts 
with 800 or 900, then the regex would be like this:
"[89]00[.-]\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d\d". the first character set [89]
means that any senctence that has 8 or 9. and rest is 
described earlier.

*** "\d" matches all the numbers. but what if we want to search
only if there are numbers like "1,2,3,4,5". we can write like 
this "[12345]". but there is a better way to do this. in that
case, we can write like this : "[1-5]".

*** same thing goes to if we search for character like "a,b,c...".
we can write "[a-z]". this returns all the characters excepts 
numbers and special ones whethes it is upper case or lower case.
in some cases, we will have to write like this: [a-zA-Z]

*** look the this example :
cat
mat
pat
bat
if we want to search everything that ends with "at", we can 
write "[a-z]at". but if we want to search everything that end
with "at" excepts starts with "b", we can write regex like this:
"[^b]at". 


*** we can make our life easier with quantifiers. instead of
writting like this : "\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d\d", we can 
write like : "\d{3}[.-]\d{3}[.-]\d{4}". this will only be 
used if we know the exact numbers of the characters. but what 
if we don't know the number of the characters. here comes 
another method. try looking line 19-23. in these lines 
there are a bunch of prefix there like "mr, mr., ms etc". how 
can we find these. let's start for findidng "mr" first. we 
can write like this : "Mr\.". in this case, all search result have
come that has a string like "mr.". but there are also some 
string which doesn't have "." character. in that case, we will
write like : "Mr\.?".(. থাকতেও পারে, নাও থাকতে পারে) this "?" returns whether there is one 
"." character or zero "." character. so, after this, there 
is a space. so we will write like : "Mr\.?\s". and after that
you know there are some character between a-z. so it will be like : 
"Mr\.?\s[a-z]". here we are seeing, we are getting only one
word character search result after "mr. ". there will be a bunch 
of characters. we will search it like : "Mr\.?\s[a-z]\w*".
here this "\w*" returns characters count for 0 or more. just
like we have used "?" earlier, where we have used it for 
determining 0 or 1 "." character. 
so far we have found the strings which have "mr. " at the 
first of the string. but what about "mrs". in that case, we 
will use group. group is obtained by parenthesis. like this :
"M(r|s)\.?\s[a-z]\w*". at the top of the string there is an "M" 
and after that there could be "r or s". using this search we 
have obtained 4 search result. we still have one left. so, 
we can write "M(r|s|rs)\.?\s[a-z]\w*".
