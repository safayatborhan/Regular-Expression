***[a-z0-9.-]+@[a-z-]+\.(com|edu|net)
this plus sign is used for if we have a bunch of characters and
after that we have something another or it can be the same
characters. let's see an example 

oreyMSchaferid
corey.schaferID
corey-321-schafer

here in these 3 lines, in first two there are "id" at the 
bottom of the strings. if we want to search whose have "id"
at the bottom of the string, we would be written like this : 
"[a-z0-9.-]+id"
